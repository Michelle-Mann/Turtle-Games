## Summary

In a 2023 summer self-motivational discovery period, I decided to work through 100 Days of Python: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/20628488?start=150#content

The module for this particular week of postings was: Turtle Graphics. From the documentation: 

Turtle graphics is an implementation of the popular geometric drawing tools introduced in Logo, developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.

In Python, turtle graphics provides a representation of a physical ‚Äúturtle‚Äù (a little robot with a pen) that draws on a sheet of paper on the floor.

It‚Äôs an effective and well-proven way for learners to encounter programming concepts and interaction with software, as it provides instant, visible feedback. It also provides convenient access to graphical output in general.

Turtle drawing was originally created as an educational tool, to be used by teachers in the classroom. For the programmer who needs to produce some graphical output it can be a way to do that without the overhead of introducing more complex or external libraries into their work.

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

This was incredibly satisfying. What a cool way to learn to code and get the satisfaction of actually "playing" with something you've created! <3
